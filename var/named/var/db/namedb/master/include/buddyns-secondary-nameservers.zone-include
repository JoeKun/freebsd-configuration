; RFC1912 section 2.8 recommends not to have any more than 7 NS records.
; Furthermore, BuddyNS's own guidance is not to exceed 5 nameservers for
; delegation. Cf. https://www.buddyns.com/support/setup/zone-delegation/
; 
; For those reasons, the list of secondary nameservers was kept to a
; total of 5.
