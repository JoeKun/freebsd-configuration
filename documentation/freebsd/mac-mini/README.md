# Old FreeBSD Documentation Mac Mini server

This directory contains old documentation on how to setup FreeBSD with multiple services on a Mac Mini.

As I am working on migrating my services to a brand new Supermicro server, and taking this opportunity to improve this documentation, the copy of the old documentation you can find here is becoming less relevant.

Furthermore, when this old documentation is ready to be retired, a few associated configuration files should be removed. Here is a list of those configuration files that will no longer be needed at that point.

 * `home/foo/.gitconfig`
 * `home/foo/.config`
 * `etc/rc.conf.d/zfs`
