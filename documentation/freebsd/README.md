# FreeBSD Documentation

This directory contains several documents going over different aspects of configuring FreeBSD for a production small scale server.

These documents are produced in the course of my journey to setup my own server for personal use, largely to increase my level of digital sovereignty.

While each document attempts to cover its own topic as thoroughly as possible, itâ€™s possible that some document will rely on pre-requisites covered in another document. Sometimes, that may be explicitly called out, whereas in other instances it may not be obvious.

If you suspect there may be an unspecified pre-requisite in any of these documents, it may be helpful to know the order of documents which corresponds to how I configured my own server.
